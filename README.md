This is a React app that shows a list of hotel rooms with infinite scroll.

**Features:**
- Each room has variants with images or videos, price, and details
- Videos play when visible and pause when not
- Images load responsively and lazily
- Responsive for mobile and desktop
- Modern UI with smooth animations
- Error and loading states are handled
- Modular and easy to extend

**Local setup:**
- Clone the repo
- Go into the project folder
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

**Note:**
Because the original sample.json was very large, I created my own dummy data setup to mimic the same experience for development and testing.
